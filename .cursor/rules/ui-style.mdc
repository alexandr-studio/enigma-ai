- Use Tailwind CSS v4 and shadcn/ui for all styling and UI components.
- Keep the layout minimal, functional, and practical.
- Use warm color tones. Avoid dark gray or harsh contrasts unless explicitly instructed.
- Use `shadcn/ui` form components unless custom interaction is required.
- All interactions must work without full page reloads.
