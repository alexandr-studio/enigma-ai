## Technical Decisions & Open Questions

### Character Set Mapping
**❓ User input required**: What should the 64-symbol character set include?
- Current assumption: A-Z (26) + 0-9 (10) + space + common punctuation (27 symbols)
- Alternative: ASCII subset, Unicode blocks, or custom symbol set?

### Obfuscation Complexity
**❓ User input required**: Should obfuscation features be:
- Always enabled by default?
- User-configurable with presets?
- Advanced-user only (hidden behind settings)?

### Mobile Experience Priority
**❓ User input required**: What's the primary use case?
- Desktop-first with mobile adaptation?
- Mobile-first responsive design?
- Equal priority for both platforms?

### Rotor Sharing Method
**❓ User input required**: How should users share rotor configurations?
- QR codes for mobile convenience?
- Text-based codes only?
- File export/import functionality?

## Success Metrics

### Core Functionality
- [ ] Messages encode/decode identically with same rotor set + start positions
- [ ] All rotor configurations persist correctly in localStorage
- [ ] UI works smoothly on desktop and mobile devices
- [ ] Core encryption logic is thoroughly tested and documented

### Security Features
- [ ] Obfuscation eliminates word repetitions completely
- [ ] Position-based attacks are mitigated through shuffling
- [ ] Statistical analysis resistance is demonstrably improved
- [ ] Source code disclosure doesn't compromise encryption without keys

### User Experience
- [ ] Setup process is intuitive for non-technical users
- [ ] Error messages are clear and actionable
- [ ] Performance remains smooth with messages up to 10,000 characters
- [ ] No data loss occurs during normal operation

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Rotor generation randomness**: Use crypto.getRandomValues() for security
- **localStorage limitations**: Implement quota checking and data compression
- **Cross-browser compatibility**: Test on all major browsers and versions

### Security Risks
- **Client-side key exposure**: Document security assumptions clearly
- **Rotor predictability**: Ensure proper entropy in random generation
- **Obfuscation reversibility**: Comprehensive testing of edge cases

### User Experience Risks
- **Complexity overwhelming users**: Progressive disclosure and clear onboarding
- **Data loss**: Regular backup reminders and export functionality
- **Performance degradation**: Lazy loading and optimization for large datasets
